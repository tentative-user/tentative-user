Hi, I'm @tentative-user. You can also call me George. I'm interested in coding in Python, just for enjoyment.
Most of my scripts have something to do with text processing. You can contact me at joueur91@hotmail.com

I have not created any serious project so far but wanted to test creating a GitHub account anyway.
That is why what I am publishing here is just a handful of functions I find useful and use repeatedly in my scripts.
Except the last (and the biggest) one which is just my most recent experiment.

You may use any of these functions freely and if you care to suggest some improvements please let me know.
